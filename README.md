# SmartBrain-API

 ## This project was built and the followed manner:
  * FrontEnd: HTML, CSS, Javascript/React
  * BackEnd: Node.js, Express.js
  * Database: PostgreSQL
   
 ## Back End
   * Took into account that one cant just save a passowrd without it being hashed and it can never be saved as the original beacause if the companies has a breach and the database has all the passwords then the user will be at risk. So all the passwords are hashed using `bycrypt`.
    
    
    
 ## To use
  1. Please register to experience the web app.
      * Incase you are worried about your account being stolen don't worry your password is encrypted and the original password is never saved ;) .
  2. Once in the site go find a JPEG URL with faces and enter it in the input bar and see the magic.
  3. When done, you can sign out if you wish and dont worry your entires are saved in the database so you wont lose your info.
